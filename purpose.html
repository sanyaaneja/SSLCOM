            <h1>Purpose</h1>
            <p>The staff student committee is meant to serve as a bridge between the
                students and staff regarding important issues that need to be looked into,
                such as, teaching, examinations, departmental policies and student issues.
                These students act as representatives of their community, by raising views of
                students to the department regarding the quality of teaching, curriculum changes,
                departmental services, etc.
                This helps in improving channels of communication between staff and students.
            </p>

            <p>
                An academic representative is a student volunteer who represents their classmates to their department.
                They bring ideas to the table over the course of the year, and gather feedback from classmates
                regarding the changes they'd like to see in their programme.

                As an academic rep, your responsibilities will include attending 3 to 4 departmental
                meetings across the year, while collaborating with other academic reps and staff to create change at the
                university.

                Academic reps hence ensure the student experience is the best it can possibly be by working
                with and challenging these groups.

                The university has over a 1000 academic reps volunteering at the university.
